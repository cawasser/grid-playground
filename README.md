# grid-playground

(based on shadow-cljs - browser quickstart)

This is a minimum template you can use as the basis for CLJS projects intended to run in the browser.

## Purpose

Provide a simplified implementation of ["react-grid-layout"](https://github.com/strml/react-grid-layout) to make it
easier to develop/debug rendering of the content elements placed into the grid (the dreaded "flash", where every
"widget" does a full-render anytime one of the other "widgets" gets a data update).
